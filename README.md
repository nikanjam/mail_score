# mail_score
Mail_score is a set of scripts designed to validate SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records of email sender domains. These scripts are integrated into Exim using three Access Control Lists (ACLs) to ensure email security and proper routing. It supports both DirectAdmin and cPanel control panels for seamless integration and operation.
